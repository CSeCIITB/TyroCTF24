### Description

<blockquote>
Check out my new Aura calculator!!! it derives aura value by solving a 4th degree non homogenous partial differential equation with fanum tax, rizz, gyatt and mewing among other parameters. Dont get it? Dont worry, its all handled backend. Gotta keep this technology out of the hands of Robots, you know.
Keep gooning, dab from the admin.
